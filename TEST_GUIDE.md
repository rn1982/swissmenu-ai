# SwissMenu AI - Testing Guide

## üöÄ Quick Start Testing

### 1. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000

### 2. Test User Flow

#### A. Homepage
- Should see welcome message in French
- "Commencer" button to start

#### B. User Preferences (/preferences)
- Test form with:
  - Number of people: 2
  - Meals per day: 3
  - Budget: 150 CHF
  - Select some dietary restrictions
  - Select cuisine preferences
  - Cooking level: intermediate
- Submit form

#### C. Menu Generation (/menu)
- Click "G√©n√©rer mon menu" button
- Wait for AI to generate menu (10-20 seconds)
- Should see weekly menu with Swiss dishes

#### D. Shopping List (/shopping)
- Click "Voir ma liste de courses"
- Should see ingredients matched to real Migros products
- Each product should have:
  - Name and quantity
  - Price in CHF
  - Working Migros URL (test a few)

## üîç Testing ScrapingBee Integration

### 1. Check Current Products
```bash
# View all pasta products with prices
npx tsx src/scripts/check-pasta-products.ts

# Check overall database stats
npx tsx src/scripts/check-scraping-progress.ts
```

### 2. Test Live Scraping
```bash
# Quick test - scrapes 10 pasta products
npm run scrape:migros -- --test --limit 10
```

Expected output:
- Should show "ScrapingBee response received"
- Products with names and CHF prices
- Creates/updates in database

### 3. Monitor Progress
In another terminal while scraping:
```bash
# Watch progress in real-time
npx tsx src/scripts/check-scraping-progress.ts
```

## üß™ API Testing

### 1. System Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/debug
```

### 2. Product Database Status
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/products/enhanced-sync
```

### 3. User Preferences
```bash
# List all preferences
curl http://localhost:3000/api/preferences
```

## üìä Database Inspection

### 1. Prisma Studio (Visual)
```bash
npx prisma studio
```
Opens at http://localhost:5555
- Check MigrosProduct table
- Verify prices and URLs

### 2. Direct Database Queries
```bash
# Count products by category
npx tsx -e "
import { db } from './src/lib/db'
const cats = await db.migrosProduct.groupBy({
  by: ['category'],
  _count: true
})
console.table(cats)
"
```

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### 1. "Environment variable not found"
```bash
# Make sure .env.local exists and contains:
DATABASE_URL="your_neon_connection_string"
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_claude_api_key"
SCRAPINGBEE_API_KEY="your_scrapingbee_key"
```

### 2. Scraping Timeout
- Normal for large scraping runs
- Check progress with monitoring scripts
- Process continues in background

### 3. Price Discrepancies
- Known issue: some products show family pack prices
- Example: Macaronis showing 3.95 instead of 1.90
- Will be addressed with price validation feature

# This will take ~1.5-2 hours
# Monitor with progress script
```

### Test Specific Categories
```bash
# Check meat products
npx tsx -e "
import { db } from './src/lib/db'
const meat = await db.migrosProduct.findMany({
  where: { category: 'meat-poultry' }
})
console.table(meat.map(p => ({
  name: p.name,
  price: p.priceChf,
  url: p.url
})))
"
```
