# Product Matching Improvements - January 2025

## 🎯 Current Success Rate: 68% Functional

### ✅ Improvements Implemented

1. **Critical Product Additions**
   - ✅ Filet de lieu noir frais (instead of canned tuna)
   - ✅ Beurre M-Classic (instead of yogurt drink)
   - ✅ Jambon blanc (instead of mushrooms)
   - ✅ Gruyère râpé (instead of fromage frais)
   - ✅ Farine blanche (instead of olives)
   - ✅ Pain blanc (instead of puff pastry)

2. **Algorithm Enhancements**
   - Added compound ingredient detection (e.g., "filet de lieu noir", "gruyère râpé")
   - Improved category-specific matching
   - Added fallback search URLs for all products
   - Enhanced clean ingredient list from AI with `ingredients_summary`

### 🔄 Remaining Issues to Fix

1. **Missing Products**
   - ❌ Bouillon de légumes (currently missing completely)
   - ❌ Graines de sésame (falls back to sunflower seeds)
   - ❌ Riz basmati (matches to rice panure instead of actual rice)

2. **Match Quality**
   - Current functional rate: 68%
   - Problematic matches: 23%
   - Approximate matches: 9%

### 📝 Next Steps

1. Add missing products:
   - Bouillon de légumes (cubes/powder)
   - Graines de sésame
   - Riz basmati specific product

2. Improve matching algorithm:
   - Better handling of specific product types (e.g., basmati vs regular rice)
   - More accurate spice/seed matching
   - Enhanced brand preference logic

3. Expand product database:
   - Continue scraping with ScrapingBee
   - Add more product variants
   - Include seasonal items

### 🚀 Success Metrics

- **Before**: ~45% accurate matches with many critical failures
- **After**: 68% functional matches with proper essentials
- **Target**: 90%+ accurate matches

### 💡 Key Learnings

1. Compound ingredients need special handling (e.g., "gruyère râpé" not just "fromage")
2. Category alone is insufficient - need specific product matching
3. Swiss context requires specific products (e.g., Gruyère AOP, not generic cheese)
4. AI-generated clean ingredient lists dramatically improve matching accuracy
